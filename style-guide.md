no no
it means, the design were created based on the width. It's just like a piece of information. It has no use for your code 
:eeeeee:
you can compare it with this sentence, "The sun rises on the east everyday"


another question : when for fonts I'm given this information for the weights
- Family: [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)
- Weights: 300, 400, 600
Does it mezean I can choose between this sizes or it depends on the different typo given by the design I'm propose "to code"( I don't know if I can use therm code when I'm using only html and css haha ?

it means, you need to use only the given weights of that font. No other font and no other weights.
