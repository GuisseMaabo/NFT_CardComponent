## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Through this callenge I've learn a lot on how to structure my html tags and the usage of selectors classes. I've also improve my abilities on box-sizing and positionning. 
I have more understanding on margins and paddings.
Using css units like : vh, % , em, and px make me understand more about their impact on the responsive aspect of my app. 


### Continued development


As we start the year 2022, this Challenge is the first I've realised and will continue making new challenges and projects that.
So as feel more confortable in all the concepts I'm not really confortable. And discover new areas of web development.
